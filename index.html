      Welcome to the Internet Roshambo Dojo!

        Your path to Rock, Paper, Scissors superstardom begins here!
      </h2>
  

  <h3>Are you ready to become a Rock, Paper, Scissors LEGEND?</h3>
  <p>If you want to be the best, you're going to need to train. And as much as we hate to admit it, Level 9 CPUs can only take you so far (even in a game with only three simple choices) - so we're going to train you against real, breathing humans. Whether it be your friends across the room or some random dude in Ulaanbaatar, the experience you're going to get against living, breathing, thinking humans will prepare you for the ultimate goal.</p>

  <p>First things first, though - we're going to need you to sign up. Fill out this form and we'll get you set up with an opponent.</p>
